More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren’t yet on side. Our wide range of output – from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions – does exactly that.\\\\n\\\\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can’t do anything with nothing. We won’t charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don’t have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us – we just have you.\\\\n\\\\nNot everyone can afford to give – but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we’re doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared – so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve achieved so much already – but the truth is, we’ve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics.'],\n",

       "  'Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post’s Katharine Graham (Streep), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents. The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers – and their very freedom – to help bring long-buried truths to light.\\\\n\\\\nThe Post marks the first time Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, Spielberg produces along with Amy Pascal and Kristie Macosko Krieger. The script was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the film features an acclaimed ensemble cast including Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods.\\\\n\\\\nIn Theaters December 22, 2017\\\\n\\\\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\\\\n\\\\nScreenplay by: Liz Hannah, Josh Singer\\\\n\\\\nProduced by: Steven Spielberg, Amy Pascal and Kristie Macisko Krieger\\\\n\\\\nCast: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/FOXSubscribe\\\\n\\\\nConnect with The Post Online:\\\\nVisit the Official Site Here: http://ThePostMovie.com \\\\nLike The Post on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/ThePostOfficial\\\\nFollow The Post on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ThePostMovie\\\\nFollow The Post on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ThePostMovie\\\\n\\\\n#ThePost\\\\n\\\\nAbout 20th Century FOX:\\\\nOfficial YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\\\\n\\\\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \\\\nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\\\\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\\\\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\\\\n\\\\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\\\\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\\\\n\\\\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\\\\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\\\\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\\\\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\\\\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\\\\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton. The first date sold out quickly due to huge demand; a handful of tickets are still available for the second show. Further details can be found on the band’s website: www.thunderonline.com.\\\\n\\\\nTRACK LIST “CHRISTMAS DAY” CD SINGLE\\\\n1. Christmas Day\\\\n2. Love Walked In (2017 Version)\\\\n3.

'몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 현재의 블락비를 관통하는 결과물인 것.\\\\n \\\\n그런 만큼 누구 하나 빠지지 않는 멤버들의 고르고 적극적인 참여가 돋보인다. 블락비의 프로듀서 지코를 필두로 맏형인 비범은 솔로곡 '기브 앤 테이크(Give & Take)'를 직접 만들었고, 박경은 세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'를 비롯하여 네 번째 트랙인 블락비 보컬 유닛(태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 발라드곡 '이렇게'를 작사 작곡했다. \\\\n \\\\n블락비 본연의 색깔을 잘 살린 타이틀곡부터 첫 발라드 유닛곡 등 장르도 다양하다. 독특한 사운드와 개성 있는 랩을 들려주지만 트렌디함과 대중성을 놓치지 않았다. '몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 뮤지션으로 한층 견고해진 블락비의 진가를 확인할 수 있는 앨범이다. \\\\n \\\\n1. My Zone\\\\n첫 번째 트랙인 'My Zone'은 블락비의 원초적인 자유분방함을 다시금 느끼게 해주는 곡이다. 펑크, 일렉, 트랩 세 가지 장르가 하이브리드된 독특한 편곡은 곡을 듣는 내내 한시도 지루할 틈 없고, 후렴구의 기타 리프가 감각적이다. 'My Zone'이란 제목처럼 '어디가든 앵콜 요구 빗발쳐' 등의 스웩 넘치는 가사와 강렬한 래핑이 어우러져 에너지가 넘친다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, Penomeco / Composed by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J / Arranged by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J \\\\n\\\\n2. Shall We Dance \\\\n두 번째 트랙은 타이틀곡 'Shall We Dance'다. 지코가 프로듀싱한 곡으로 디지털과 아날로그 소스의 자연스러운 조화로 트렌디함과 빈티지한 감성을 동시에 느낄 수 있는 라틴 바이브의 업템포 댄스다. 독특한 사운드에 대중성까지 잘 녹여낸 이 곡은 평범함을 거부하는 블락비만의 매력이 가장 잘 담긴 트랙이다. 멤버들 각각의 개성이 잘 드러나는 랩과 '지금이 피크야 꽁무니 빼지마', '쭈뼛대는 사람은 못 껴' 등의 가사가 위트 있다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, 박경 / Composed by ZICO, Poptime / Arranged by ZICO, Poptime\\\\n\\\\n3. 일방적이야\\\\n세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 노래이다. 대화로도 좁혀지지 않는 연인과의 입장 차이를 대변한 곡이다. '내 시간만 좀 가질라치면 그걸 바로 넌 마음의 크기라 정의해', '구속 아닌 구속으로 내 숨통을 조여 겨울인데도 더워' 등의 가사가 재미있고, 레게 리듬이 흥겨움을 더한다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경, ZICO / Composed by 박경, 13 / Arranged by 13\\\\n\\\\n4. 이렇게 (Vocal Unit)\\\\n네 번째 트랙 '이렇게'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 곡으로 블락비 보컬 유닛(메인보컬 태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 첫 발라드다. 놓쳐버린 사랑에 후회하는 연인들의 마음을 애절하게 풀어냈다. '어제의 꿈같았던 널'이란 가사가 특히 아련하게 다가온다. 감미로운 피아노 선율이 잔잔하게 깔리는 멜로디가 아름답고, 네 멤버의 목소리가 편안하고 포근하게 감싼다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경 / Composed by 박경, 심재훈, 박중훈 / Arranged by 박중훈\\\\n\\\\n5. Give & Take (B-BOMB Solo)\\\\n다섯 번째 트랙 'Give & Take'는 블락비의 퍼포먼스 라인 비범이 작사 작곡한 곡이다. 펑키한 일렉기타 리듬과 Synth Pad를 기반으로 한 디스코풍의 곡이다. 감각적인 비트에 비범의 섹시한 매력이 오롯이 담겼다.\\\\nLyrics by B-BOMB / Composed by B-BOMB, 김진호, 박현규 / Arranged by 김진호, 정동환, 최선용\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[CREDITS]\\\\n\\\\n1.

If you thought the world made some kind of sense, you may have questioned yourself a few times in the past two years. And that questioning, that erosion of faith - in people, in institutions, in shared experience - runs through every song on the new Field Music album.\\\\n\\\\nThe brother’s studio, on the banks of the river Wear, became a sanctuary away from everything political and personal, a cocoon of creativity. And conversely, making the album became an alternative way to connect to people, with a wide array of musicians invited to leave their mark, notably Sarah Hayes on flute and piccolo, Liz Corney on vocals, Pete Fraser on saxophone, Simon Dennis on trumpet and flugelhorn, a Cornshed Sisters choir and the regular string quartet of Ed Cross, Jo Montgomery, Chrissie Slater and Ele Leckie. The result is a record that is bigger in scale, grander than anything they've done before. \\\\nDavid Brewis explains, “where Commontime felt like a distillation of all of the elements that make up Field Music, this feels like an expansion; as if we’re pushing in every direction at once to see how far we can go”.\\\\nField Music have also announced a string of UK shows in 2018.  The dates include special shows at the Barbican in London and The Northern Stage in Newcastle with strings, horns, woodwind and assorted percussion provided by the Open Here Orchestra.\\\\n \\\\nField Music 2018 live dates\\\\n\\\\nTickets: http://smarturl.it/fieldmusic2018tour\\\\n\\\\n02 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage  Matinee Show \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage Evening Show\\\\n08 Mar Brighton, Komedia \\\\n09 Mar, Bristol, The Lantern\\\\n10 Mar, Southampton, Engine Rooms \\\\n11 Mar, Exeter, Phoenix\\\\n15 Mar, Birmingham, O2 Institute 2\\\\n16 Mar, Manchester, Gorilla\\\\n17 Mar, Glasgow, Saint Luke's\\\\n22 Mar, Liverpool, Arts Club\\\\n23 Mar, Sheffield, Foundry\\\\n24 Mar, Norwich, The Waterfront\\\\n25 May, London, Barbican with the Open Here Orchestra\"],\n",

Hope everyone is doing well during these unpredictable times. In light of the Harvey Weinstein scandals sparking a massive movement of women and survivors speaking out against sexual assault, I find myself in awe and moved to my core. Since the age of 14 I’ve survived several acts of sexual assault. For years, I blamed myself and secretly carried the shame. When I did realize it wasn’t my fault and that I deserve to heal, I wrote a song called “Quiet,” which went viral after I sang it with a choir on the streets @ the D.C. Women’s March.\\\\n \\\\nSince then I have teamed up with Atlantic Records to create a hopeful, new version that incorporates survivors singing with me. I’ve seen this song help survivors speak out after the Women’s March, and I believe that the new version has the power to encourage and empower all those thinking of coming forward at this time.\\\\n \\\\nEven though I was planning to release this new version of “Quiet” in January, I believe the movement is happening now, and I want to support those breaking the silence by releasing “Quiet” early. I’m deeply moved Julie Greenwald @ Atlantic is standing beside me through this change of plan. She understands that it’s my gesture of support & encouragement to all the survivors rising. It’s my musical #METOO.\\\\n \\\\nI hope you’ll listen and consider standing with us as well.

She then dropped to the floor and multiple members of the crew could be seen rushing to her aid.\\\\n\\\\nWilliams said that she had overheated after an extended break and that the episode was not a stunt. She was dressed in green sequined leggings and a green sequined top along with a green wig and green foil crown for her Statue of Liberty costume. After the incident, an ambulance arrived on the scene and a wheelchair was taken out of the emergency vehicle An Escalade arrived a short time after and was ushered into the garage buy Williams' security team.\"],\n",

More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren’t yet on side. Our wide range of output – from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions – does exactly that.\\\\n\\\\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can’t do anything with nothing. We won’t charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don’t have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us – we just have you.\\\\n\\\\nNot everyone can afford to give – but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we’re doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared – so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve achieved so much already – but the truth is, we’ve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics.'],\n",

       "  'Steven Spielberg directs Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks in The Post, a thrilling drama about the unlikely partnership between The Washington Post’s Katharine Graham (Streep), the first female publisher of a major American newspaper, and editor Ben Bradlee (Hanks), as they race to catch up with The New York Times to expose a massive cover-up of government secrets that spanned three decades and four U.S. Presidents. The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers – and their very freedom – to help bring long-buried truths to light.\\\\n\\\\nThe Post marks the first time Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, Spielberg produces along with Amy Pascal and Kristie Macosko Krieger. The script was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the film features an acclaimed ensemble cast including Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods.\\\\n\\\\nIn Theaters December 22, 2017\\\\n\\\\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\\\\n\\\\nScreenplay by: Liz Hannah, Josh Singer\\\\n\\\\nProduced by: Steven Spielberg, Amy Pascal and Kristie Macisko Krieger\\\\n\\\\nCast: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/FOXSubscribe\\\\n\\\\nConnect with The Post Online:\\\\nVisit the Official Site Here: http://ThePostMovie.com \\\\nLike The Post on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/ThePostOfficial\\\\nFollow The Post on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ThePostMovie\\\\nFollow The Post on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ThePostMovie\\\\n\\\\n#ThePost\\\\n\\\\nAbout 20th Century FOX:\\\\nOfficial YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\\\\n\\\\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \\\\nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\\\\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\\\\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\\\\n\\\\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\\\\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\\\\n\\\\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\\\\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\\\\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\\\\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\\\\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\\\\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton. The first date sold out quickly due to huge demand; a handful of tickets are still available for the second show. Further details can be found on the band’s website: www.thunderonline.com.\\\\n\\\\nTRACK LIST “CHRISTMAS DAY” CD SINGLE\\\\n1. Christmas Day\\\\n2. Love Walked In (2017 Version)\\\\n3.

'몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 현재의 블락비를 관통하는 결과물인 것.\\\\n \\\\n그런 만큼 누구 하나 빠지지 않는 멤버들의 고르고 적극적인 참여가 돋보인다. 블락비의 프로듀서 지코를 필두로 맏형인 비범은 솔로곡 '기브 앤 테이크(Give & Take)'를 직접 만들었고, 박경은 세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'를 비롯하여 네 번째 트랙인 블락비 보컬 유닛(태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 발라드곡 '이렇게'를 작사 작곡했다. \\\\n \\\\n블락비 본연의 색깔을 잘 살린 타이틀곡부터 첫 발라드 유닛곡 등 장르도 다양하다. 독특한 사운드와 개성 있는 랩을 들려주지만 트렌디함과 대중성을 놓치지 않았다. '몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 뮤지션으로 한층 견고해진 블락비의 진가를 확인할 수 있는 앨범이다. \\\\n \\\\n1. My Zone\\\\n첫 번째 트랙인 'My Zone'은 블락비의 원초적인 자유분방함을 다시금 느끼게 해주는 곡이다. 펑크, 일렉, 트랩 세 가지 장르가 하이브리드된 독특한 편곡은 곡을 듣는 내내 한시도 지루할 틈 없고, 후렴구의 기타 리프가 감각적이다. 'My Zone'이란 제목처럼 '어디가든 앵콜 요구 빗발쳐' 등의 스웩 넘치는 가사와 강렬한 래핑이 어우러져 에너지가 넘친다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, Penomeco / Composed by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J / Arranged by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J \\\\n\\\\n2. Shall We Dance \\\\n두 번째 트랙은 타이틀곡 'Shall We Dance'다. 지코가 프로듀싱한 곡으로 디지털과 아날로그 소스의 자연스러운 조화로 트렌디함과 빈티지한 감성을 동시에 느낄 수 있는 라틴 바이브의 업템포 댄스다. 독특한 사운드에 대중성까지 잘 녹여낸 이 곡은 평범함을 거부하는 블락비만의 매력이 가장 잘 담긴 트랙이다. 멤버들 각각의 개성이 잘 드러나는 랩과 '지금이 피크야 꽁무니 빼지마', '쭈뼛대는 사람은 못 껴' 등의 가사가 위트 있다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, 박경 / Composed by ZICO, Poptime / Arranged by ZICO, Poptime\\\\n\\\\n3. 일방적이야\\\\n세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 노래이다. 대화로도 좁혀지지 않는 연인과의 입장 차이를 대변한 곡이다. '내 시간만 좀 가질라치면 그걸 바로 넌 마음의 크기라 정의해', '구속 아닌 구속으로 내 숨통을 조여 겨울인데도 더워' 등의 가사가 재미있고, 레게 리듬이 흥겨움을 더한다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경, ZICO / Composed by 박경, 13 / Arranged by 13\\\\n\\\\n4. 이렇게 (Vocal Unit)\\\\n네 번째 트랙 '이렇게'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 곡으로 블락비 보컬 유닛(메인보컬 태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 첫 발라드다. 놓쳐버린 사랑에 후회하는 연인들의 마음을 애절하게 풀어냈다. '어제의 꿈같았던 널'이란 가사가 특히 아련하게 다가온다. 감미로운 피아노 선율이 잔잔하게 깔리는 멜로디가 아름답고, 네 멤버의 목소리가 편안하고 포근하게 감싼다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경 / Composed by 박경, 심재훈, 박중훈 / Arranged by 박중훈\\\\n\\\\n5. Give & Take (B-BOMB Solo)\\\\n다섯 번째 트랙 'Give & Take'는 블락비의 퍼포먼스 라인 비범이 작사 작곡한 곡이다. 펑키한 일렉기타 리듬과 Synth Pad를 기반으로 한 디스코풍의 곡이다. 감각적인 비트에 비범의 섹시한 매력이 오롯이 담겼다.\\\\nLyrics by B-BOMB / Composed by B-BOMB, 김진호, 박현규 / Arranged by 김진호, 정동환, 최선용\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[CREDITS]\\\\n\\\\n1.

If you thought the world made some kind of sense, you may have questioned yourself a few times in the past two years. And that questioning, that erosion of faith - in people, in institutions, in shared experience - runs through every song on the new Field Music album.\\\\n\\\\nThe brother’s studio, on the banks of the river Wear, became a sanctuary away from everything political and personal, a cocoon of creativity. And conversely, making the album became an alternative way to connect to people, with a wide array of musicians invited to leave their mark, notably Sarah Hayes on flute and piccolo, Liz Corney on vocals, Pete Fraser on saxophone, Simon Dennis on trumpet and flugelhorn, a Cornshed Sisters choir and the regular string quartet of Ed Cross, Jo Montgomery, Chrissie Slater and Ele Leckie. The result is a record that is bigger in scale, grander than anything they've done before. \\\\nDavid Brewis explains, “where Commontime felt like a distillation of all of the elements that make up Field Music, this feels like an expansion; as if we’re pushing in every direction at once to see how far we can go”.\\\\nField Music have also announced a string of UK shows in 2018.  The dates include special shows at the Barbican in London and The Northern Stage in Newcastle with strings, horns, woodwind and assorted percussion provided by the Open Here Orchestra.\\\\n \\\\nField Music 2018 live dates\\\\n\\\\nTickets: http://smarturl.it/fieldmusic2018tour\\\\n\\\\n02 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage  Matinee Show \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage Evening Show\\\\n08 Mar Brighton, Komedia \\\\n09 Mar, Bristol, The Lantern\\\\n10 Mar, Southampton, Engine Rooms \\\\n11 Mar, Exeter, Phoenix\\\\n15 Mar, Birmingham, O2 Institute 2\\\\n16 Mar, Manchester, Gorilla\\\\n17 Mar, Glasgow, Saint Luke's\\\\n22 Mar, Liverpool, Arts Club\\\\n23 Mar, Sheffield, Foundry\\\\n24 Mar, Norwich, The Waterfront\\\\n25 May, London, Barbican with the Open Here Orchestra\"],\n",

Ringing in at a mere $1.50, Meng’s perfected braised chicken recipe was passed down to him by his uncle. Now, he’s serving hundreds of meals a day out of his hawker in Singapore. And while his food has gained acclaim and recognition across the culinary community, Meng hasn’t forgotten his roots. He’s still serving up the same great food, all for under two bucks.\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\\\\n\\\\nThis story is a part of our Flavors series, where we do so much more than play with our food.

       "  \"사랑에 빠져 돌아온 러블리즈, 추운 겨울 두근대는 설레임을 담은 세 번째 미니앨범 발매!\\\\nLovelyz 3rd Mini Album [Fall in Lovelyz]\\\\n\\\\n \\\\n그룹 러블리즈가 11월 14일 미니 3집 [Fall in Lovelyz]을 발매하며 깜짝 컴백한다.\\\\n\\\\n러블리즈는 지난 2월 정규 2집 [R U Ready?]와 5월 정규 2집 리패키지 [지금, 우리]를 발매하며\\\\n두 번째 단독 콘서트 ‘Alwayz’까지 성황리에 마쳤으며 하반기에도 활발한 활동을 펼치고자\\\\n미니 3집 앨범을 발매하기로 결정. 또 한 번 겨울의 러블리즈를 볼 수 있게 됐다.\\\\n이번 미니 3집은 러블리즈만의 감성이 가장 돋보일 수 있는 계절인 겨울에 찾아오는 것으로\\\\n매 앨범 마다 높은 완성도와 한층 성장된 실력으로 컴백하는 만큼, 앨범에 대한 관심이 뜨겁다.\\\\n특히, 이번 앨범에서는 최근 떠오르는 프로듀서인 원택(1Take)과 탁(TAK)의 협업으로\\\\n새로운 러블리즈만의 감성과 세계관을 성립하며 또 다른 시너지를 만들어 낼 것이다.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n러블리즈는 2014년 11월 12일 특유의 사랑스러움과 청순함으로 가요계에 대체 불가능한 걸그룹으로서\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n첫 1위와 두 번의 단독 콘서트, 뮤지컬까지 다방면으로 활동하고 있는 가운데 미니 3집으로 전격 컴백을 알렸다.\\\\n데뷔 3주년의 의미를 담은 이번 앨범은 러블리즈를 항상 응원하고 사랑해준 팬들을 위해 러블리즈가 선사하는\\\\n선물 같은 앨범으로 어느 때 보다 정성을 다해 완성됐다.\\\\n\\\\n앨범 명 ‘Fall in Lovelyz’는 늦은 가을에서 겨울로 넘어가는 사이 계절의 분위기와 러블리즈만의\\\\n특별한 감성을 담아 지어졌으며, 사랑에 빠진 러블리즈와 이들에게 빠지게 될 모든 사람들의\\\\n설레고 벅찬 감정을 오롯이 표현하는 앨범이라는 의미를 담았다.\\\\n\\\\n러블리즈의 미니 3집에는 타이틀 곡 ‘종소리’을 포함 총 7곡으로 모두 신곡으로 채워졌다.\\\\n트랙에는 잔잔하게 퍼지는 여운을 담은 발라드부터 동화 속의 한 장면을 연상케 하는 몽환적인 곡까지\\\\n다채롭게 수록되어 우리의 귀를 즐겁게 해줄 것이다.\\\\n\\\\n타이틀 곡 ‘종소리’는 러블리즈가 새롭게 시도하는 Complextro 사운드와 ELECTRO-POP이라는 장르가 만난 곡으로\\\\n원택(1Take), 탁(TAK)이 작사, 작곡한 곡이다. 러블리즈와 처음 작업에 완벽 호흡을 자랑한 원택(1Take), 탁(TAK)은\\\\n인피니트의 ‘AIR’, 골든차일드의 ‘내 눈을 의심해’를 통해 새로운 사운드를 선보인 바 있다.\\\\n‘두근대는 설레임의 시작’, ‘귓가에 맴도는 종소리’라는 순정만화 판타지를 컨셉으로 러블리즈만의\\\\n사랑스러운 세계관을 담은 겨울에 듣기 좋은 곡으로 탄생됐다.\\\\n\\\\n또한, 곡 중간에 들려오는 은은한 종소리가 한겨울 크리스마스 분위기를 떠오르게 하는 묘한 설렘을 불러일으키며\\\\n러블리즈의 파워풀한 군무와 다이나믹한 동선변화가 어우러진 안무로 화려한 무대를 꾸밀 예정이다.\\\\n이외에도 인트로 곡인 ‘Spotlight’와 수록곡 ‘삼각형’, ‘그냥’, ‘FALLIN’’, ‘비밀정원’, ‘졸린 꿈’까지 총 7곡이 수록되어있다.\\\\n‘삼각형’은 남녀의 삼각 관계를 경쾌한 사운드와 엮어 센스 있게 표현한 곡이며, ‘그냥’은 별다른 이유 없이\\\\n매번 ‘그냥’이라고 말하는 남자에 대해 혼란스러우면서도 슬프고 설레는 감정을 담은 곡이다.\\\\n특히, ‘FALLIN’’은 지난 7월 열린 러블리즈의 두 번째 단독 콘서트 ‘Alwayz’에서 선공개된 곡으로\\\\n사랑하는 연인과의 약속을 그려낸 가사에 러블리즈가 팬들에게 하고 싶은 말을 비유한 R&B 곡이다.\\\\n뿐만 아니라 어릴적 상상했던 동화적 환상을 담은 ‘졸린 꿈’과 ‘기억’과 ‘꿈’이 있는 곳을\\\\n정원으로 표현한 ‘비밀정원’까지 다채롭게 채워졌다. 이처럼 러블리즈의 미니 3집 [Fall in Lovelyz]은\\\\n추운 겨울, 우리들의 마음을 녹여줄 수 있는 설레고 따뜻한 앨범이 될 것이다.\\\\n\\\\nCJ E&M Music은 아시아 No.1 엔터테인먼트 기업인 CJ E&M의 음악사업 브랜드로 음원/음반의 투자/제작/유통부터 콘서트/페스티벌 개최까지 포함하고 있습니다.

More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren’t yet on side. Our wide range of output – from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions – does exactly that.\\\\n\\\\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can’t do anything with nothing. We won’t charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don’t have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us – we just have you.\\\\n\\\\nNot everyone can afford to give – but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we’re doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared – so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve achieved so much already – but the truth is, we’ve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics.'],\n",

The two must overcome their differences as they risk their careers – and their very freedom – to help bring long-buried truths to light.\\\\n\\\\nThe Post marks the first time Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated on a project. In addition to directing, Spielberg produces along with Amy Pascal and Kristie Macosko Krieger. The script was written by Liz Hannah and Josh Singer, and the film features an acclaimed ensemble cast including Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods.\\\\n\\\\nIn Theaters December 22, 2017\\\\n\\\\nDirector: Steven Spielberg\\\\n\\\\nScreenplay by: Liz Hannah, Josh Singer\\\\n\\\\nProduced by: Steven Spielberg, Amy Pascal and Kristie Macisko Krieger\\\\n\\\\nCast: Meryl Streep, Tom Hanks, Alison Brie, Carrie Coon, David Cross, Bruce Greenwood, Tracy Letts, Bob Odenkirk, Sarah Paulson, Jesse Plemons, Matthew Rhys, Michael Stuhlbarg, Bradley Whitford and Zach Woods\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: http://bit.ly/FOXSubscribe\\\\n\\\\nConnect with The Post Online:\\\\nVisit the Official Site Here: http://ThePostMovie.com \\\\nLike The Post on FACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/ThePostOfficial\\\\nFollow The Post on TWITTER: https://twitter.com/ThePostMovie\\\\nFollow The Post on INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/ThePostMovie\\\\n\\\\n#ThePost\\\\n\\\\nAbout 20th Century FOX:\\\\nOfficial YouTube Channel for 20th Century Fox Movies.

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\\\\n\\\\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \\\\nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\\\\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\\\\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\\\\n\\\\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\\\\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\\\\n\\\\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\\\\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\\\\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\\\\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\\\\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\\\\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton. The first date sold out quickly due to huge demand; a handful of tickets are still available for the second show. Further details can be found on the band’s website: www.thunderonline.com.\\\\n\\\\nTRACK LIST “CHRISTMAS DAY” CD SINGLE\\\\n1. Christmas Day\\\\n2. Love Walked In (2017 Version)\\\\n3.

If you thought the world made some kind of sense, you may have questioned yourself a few times in the past two years. And that questioning, that erosion of faith - in people, in institutions, in shared experience - runs through every song on the new Field Music album.\\\\n\\\\nThe brother’s studio, on the banks of the river Wear, became a sanctuary away from everything political and personal, a cocoon of creativity. And conversely, making the album became an alternative way to connect to people, with a wide array of musicians invited to leave their mark, notably Sarah Hayes on flute and piccolo, Liz Corney on vocals, Pete Fraser on saxophone, Simon Dennis on trumpet and flugelhorn, a Cornshed Sisters choir and the regular string quartet of Ed Cross, Jo Montgomery, Chrissie Slater and Ele Leckie. The result is a record that is bigger in scale, grander than anything they've done before. \\\\nDavid Brewis explains, “where Commontime felt like a distillation of all of the elements that make up Field Music, this feels like an expansion; as if we’re pushing in every direction at once to see how far we can go”.\\\\nField Music have also announced a string of UK shows in 2018.  The dates include special shows at the Barbican in London and The Northern Stage in Newcastle with strings, horns, woodwind and assorted percussion provided by the Open Here Orchestra.\\\\n \\\\nField Music 2018 live dates\\\\n\\\\nTickets: http://smarturl.it/fieldmusic2018tour\\\\n\\\\n02 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage  Matinee Show \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage Evening Show\\\\n08 Mar Brighton, Komedia \\\\n09 Mar, Bristol, The Lantern\\\\n10 Mar, Southampton, Engine Rooms \\\\n11 Mar, Exeter, Phoenix\\\\n15 Mar, Birmingham, O2 Institute 2\\\\n16 Mar, Manchester, Gorilla\\\\n17 Mar, Glasgow, Saint Luke's\\\\n22 Mar, Liverpool, Arts Club\\\\n23 Mar, Sheffield, Foundry\\\\n24 Mar, Norwich, The Waterfront\\\\n25 May, London, Barbican with the Open Here Orchestra\"],\n",

Ringing in at a mere $1.50, Meng’s perfected braised chicken recipe was passed down to him by his uncle. Now, he’s serving hundreds of meals a day out of his hawker in Singapore. And while his food has gained acclaim and recognition across the culinary community, Meng hasn’t forgotten his roots. He’s still serving up the same great food, all for under two bucks.\\\\n\\\\nSUBSCRIBE: https://goo.gl/vR6Acb\\\\n\\\\nThis story is a part of our Flavors series, where we do so much more than play with our food.

Be prepared for that\\\\nAdd two eggs\\\\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\\\\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \\\\n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \\\\n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\\\\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \\\\nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \\\\nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \\\\nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \\\\nReduce it to 350. \\\\nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \\\\nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \\\\nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.'],\n",

More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren’t yet on side. Our wide range of output – from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions – does exactly that.\\\\n\\\\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can’t do anything with nothing. We won’t charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don’t have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us – we just have you.\\\\n\\\\nNot everyone can afford to give – but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we’re doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared – so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve achieved so much already – but the truth is, we’ve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics.'],\n",

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\\\\n\\\\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \\\\nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\\\\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\\\\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\\\\n\\\\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\\\\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\\\\n\\\\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\\\\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\\\\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\\\\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\\\\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\\\\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton. The first date sold out quickly due to huge demand; a handful of tickets are still available for the second show. Further details can be found on the band’s website: www.thunderonline.com.\\\\n\\\\nTRACK LIST “CHRISTMAS DAY” CD SINGLE\\\\n1. Christmas Day\\\\n2. Love Walked In (2017 Version)\\\\n3.

'몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 현재의 블락비를 관통하는 결과물인 것.\\\\n \\\\n그런 만큼 누구 하나 빠지지 않는 멤버들의 고르고 적극적인 참여가 돋보인다. 블락비의 프로듀서 지코를 필두로 맏형인 비범은 솔로곡 '기브 앤 테이크(Give & Take)'를 직접 만들었고, 박경은 세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'를 비롯하여 네 번째 트랙인 블락비 보컬 유닛(태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 발라드곡 '이렇게'를 작사 작곡했다. \\\\n \\\\n블락비 본연의 색깔을 잘 살린 타이틀곡부터 첫 발라드 유닛곡 등 장르도 다양하다. 독특한 사운드와 개성 있는 랩을 들려주지만 트렌디함과 대중성을 놓치지 않았다. '몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 뮤지션으로 한층 견고해진 블락비의 진가를 확인할 수 있는 앨범이다. \\\\n \\\\n1. My Zone\\\\n첫 번째 트랙인 'My Zone'은 블락비의 원초적인 자유분방함을 다시금 느끼게 해주는 곡이다. 펑크, 일렉, 트랩 세 가지 장르가 하이브리드된 독특한 편곡은 곡을 듣는 내내 한시도 지루할 틈 없고, 후렴구의 기타 리프가 감각적이다. 'My Zone'이란 제목처럼 '어디가든 앵콜 요구 빗발쳐' 등의 스웩 넘치는 가사와 강렬한 래핑이 어우러져 에너지가 넘친다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, Penomeco / Composed by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J / Arranged by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J \\\\n\\\\n2. Shall We Dance \\\\n두 번째 트랙은 타이틀곡 'Shall We Dance'다. 지코가 프로듀싱한 곡으로 디지털과 아날로그 소스의 자연스러운 조화로 트렌디함과 빈티지한 감성을 동시에 느낄 수 있는 라틴 바이브의 업템포 댄스다. 독특한 사운드에 대중성까지 잘 녹여낸 이 곡은 평범함을 거부하는 블락비만의 매력이 가장 잘 담긴 트랙이다. 멤버들 각각의 개성이 잘 드러나는 랩과 '지금이 피크야 꽁무니 빼지마', '쭈뼛대는 사람은 못 껴' 등의 가사가 위트 있다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, 박경 / Composed by ZICO, Poptime / Arranged by ZICO, Poptime\\\\n\\\\n3. 일방적이야\\\\n세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 노래이다. 대화로도 좁혀지지 않는 연인과의 입장 차이를 대변한 곡이다. '내 시간만 좀 가질라치면 그걸 바로 넌 마음의 크기라 정의해', '구속 아닌 구속으로 내 숨통을 조여 겨울인데도 더워' 등의 가사가 재미있고, 레게 리듬이 흥겨움을 더한다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경, ZICO / Composed by 박경, 13 / Arranged by 13\\\\n\\\\n4. 이렇게 (Vocal Unit)\\\\n네 번째 트랙 '이렇게'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 곡으로 블락비 보컬 유닛(메인보컬 태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 첫 발라드다. 놓쳐버린 사랑에 후회하는 연인들의 마음을 애절하게 풀어냈다. '어제의 꿈같았던 널'이란 가사가 특히 아련하게 다가온다. 감미로운 피아노 선율이 잔잔하게 깔리는 멜로디가 아름답고, 네 멤버의 목소리가 편안하고 포근하게 감싼다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경 / Composed by 박경, 심재훈, 박중훈 / Arranged by 박중훈\\\\n\\\\n5. Give & Take (B-BOMB Solo)\\\\n다섯 번째 트랙 'Give & Take'는 블락비의 퍼포먼스 라인 비범이 작사 작곡한 곡이다. 펑키한 일렉기타 리듬과 Synth Pad를 기반으로 한 디스코풍의 곡이다. 감각적인 비트에 비범의 섹시한 매력이 오롯이 담겼다.\\\\nLyrics by B-BOMB / Composed by B-BOMB, 김진호, 박현규 / Arranged by 김진호, 정동환, 최선용\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[CREDITS]\\\\n\\\\n1.

If you thought the world made some kind of sense, you may have questioned yourself a few times in the past two years. And that questioning, that erosion of faith - in people, in institutions, in shared experience - runs through every song on the new Field Music album.\\\\n\\\\nThe brother’s studio, on the banks of the river Wear, became a sanctuary away from everything political and personal, a cocoon of creativity. And conversely, making the album became an alternative way to connect to people, with a wide array of musicians invited to leave their mark, notably Sarah Hayes on flute and piccolo, Liz Corney on vocals, Pete Fraser on saxophone, Simon Dennis on trumpet and flugelhorn, a Cornshed Sisters choir and the regular string quartet of Ed Cross, Jo Montgomery, Chrissie Slater and Ele Leckie. The result is a record that is bigger in scale, grander than anything they've done before. \\\\nDavid Brewis explains, “where Commontime felt like a distillation of all of the elements that make up Field Music, this feels like an expansion; as if we’re pushing in every direction at once to see how far we can go”.\\\\nField Music have also announced a string of UK shows in 2018.  The dates include special shows at the Barbican in London and The Northern Stage in Newcastle with strings, horns, woodwind and assorted percussion provided by the Open Here Orchestra.\\\\n \\\\nField Music 2018 live dates\\\\n\\\\nTickets: http://smarturl.it/fieldmusic2018tour\\\\n\\\\n02 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage  Matinee Show \\\\n03 Feb, Newcastle, Northern Stage Evening Show\\\\n08 Mar Brighton, Komedia \\\\n09 Mar, Bristol, The Lantern\\\\n10 Mar, Southampton, Engine Rooms \\\\n11 Mar, Exeter, Phoenix\\\\n15 Mar, Birmingham, O2 Institute 2\\\\n16 Mar, Manchester, Gorilla\\\\n17 Mar, Glasgow, Saint Luke's\\\\n22 Mar, Liverpool, Arts Club\\\\n23 Mar, Sheffield, Foundry\\\\n24 Mar, Norwich, The Waterfront\\\\n25 May, London, Barbican with the Open Here Orchestra\"],\n",

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \\\\n\\\\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \\\\n\\\\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \\\\n\\\\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \\\\nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\\\\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\\\\n\\\\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\\\\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.'],\n",

Nobody has time for that and they’re like a buck or two\\\\nTake a 13.5oz/398ml can of pure pumpkin. Not “pumpkin pie filling.” Don’t be an animal\\\\nBut that in a bowl. It’s gonna be thick. Be prepared for that\\\\nAdd two eggs\\\\nAdd 3/4 cup of sugar\\\\nAdd 1/2 teaspoon of salt \\\\n2 1/4 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice \\\\n(or if you’re a real hot shot, use 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp cloves)\\\\nWangjangle that together until it’s smooth. \\\\nSlowly add in 1 1/2 cups of 10% cream \\\\nDoubt yourself because something this liquidy could never be a pie. \\\\nPut it the undo on 425undo for 15 minutes. \\\\nReduce it to 350. \\\\nNow here’s where you’re gonna have to make a judgment call. Bake for 30 minutes but test the wobble. The wobble tells you everything. When the wobble is gone, the pie is ready. A deep dish crust could take an hour. There’s quite a range you can cook it in where it will still turn out great. \\\\nTake it out and leave it for at least an hour, and admire the process of turning a liquid into a solid. \\\\nWhip cream that son of a bitch into tomorrow.'],\n",

More than ever, we need a resilient Left. This means we need a strong Left media, capable of thinking honestly about the issues facing us, tackling these issues head-on, as well as reaching out to those who aren’t yet on side. Our wide range of output – from listicles to essays, from punchy videos to in-depth discussions – does exactly that.\\\\n\\\\nBut all this costs money: studio rent, equipment, contributor fees and digital infrastructure. We do a lot with a little, but we can’t do anything with nothing. We won’t charge for content or cash in on sponsorship deals with Pepsi. We don’t have private fortunes, or state backers, or big capital behind us – we just have you.\\\\n\\\\nNot everyone can afford to give – but if you enjoy our work, and you believe in what we’re doing, maybe you could forego a couple of your preferred beverages this month and lend us a hand instead. In the longer term, growing our regular subscriber base will allow us to meet the future well-prepared – so if you can spare a few quid a month, why not sign up for a regular subscription?\\\\n\\\\nWe’ve achieved so much already – but the truth is, we’ve barely begun. Be a part of the change. Help us build a new media for a different politics.'],\n",

What started out as a week experiment to film his life everyday for 7 days in a row has now become SACCONEJOLYS\\\\n\\\\nthis channel was formally known as LeFloofTV but was later changed to SACCONEJOLYs\\\\n\\\\nWhen Jonathan Joly married Anna Saccone they both decided that instead of Anna dropping her family name they would both take each others name and join them together.\\\\n\\\\nThey choose to use SACCONEJOLY rather then JOLYSACCONE simply because it sounded better.\\\\n\\\\nJonathan and Anna Saccone Joly have three children, Emilia Saccone Joly, Eduardo Saccone Joly and Alessia Saccone Joly. they also have six maltese dogs, Albi, Sina, Theo, Bianca, Nivea and Nuvola.\\\\n\\\\nThey moved from Ireland to the UK in 2014.\\\\n\\\\n********************************\"],\n",

The most recent “Rip it Up” charted at #3, whilst their recent live concert film “All You Can Eat” charted at #1 and their touring included a UK arena tour and numerous concerts across the world.\\\\n\\\\n “Christmas Day” is more a timeless ballad than a traditional festive carol, and reveals the band in a new light. \\\\nThe heartfelt, melancholic song features a stunning and evocative arrangement from guitarist Luke Morley to accompany the unique voice of singer Danny Bowes.\\\\nThe single is released in some highly collectable formats with exclusive additional songs released on CD for the 1st time.\\\\nThey include a new version of Thunder classic “Love Walked In”, which appears in a new re-recorded and mostly acoustic arrangement, the classic “Low Life In High Places“  featuring  similar treatment as does the more recent song “Heartbreak Hurricane“.\\\\n\\\\n“Christmas Day” is released as CD Digipak and Digital on December 1st, 2017 on earMUSIC.\\\\nThe official Thunder store also offers a wide variety of exclusive, limited fan items and bundles, including a 7inch 2-track vinyl as well as a coloured 10inch 4-track vinyl.\\\\n\\\\nPREORDER “CHRISTMAS DAY” HERE:\\\\n► Official webstore: https://thunder.tmstor.es\\\\n► CD: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_CD\\\\n► iTunes: http://smarturl.it/Thunder_Christmas_iT\\\\nThunder will be Alice Cooper's special Guest on his German tour in November.\\\\nOn December 15th and 16th Thunder perform their annual Christmas show in Wolverhampton. The first date sold out quickly due to huge demand; a handful of tickets are still available for the second show. Further details can be found on the band’s website: www.thunderonline.com.\\\\n\\\\nTRACK LIST “CHRISTMAS DAY” CD SINGLE\\\\n1. Christmas Day\\\\n2. Love Walked In (2017 Version)\\\\n3.

'몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 현재의 블락비를 관통하는 결과물인 것.\\\\n \\\\n그런 만큼 누구 하나 빠지지 않는 멤버들의 고르고 적극적인 참여가 돋보인다. 블락비의 프로듀서 지코를 필두로 맏형인 비범은 솔로곡 '기브 앤 테이크(Give & Take)'를 직접 만들었고, 박경은 세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'를 비롯하여 네 번째 트랙인 블락비 보컬 유닛(태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 발라드곡 '이렇게'를 작사 작곡했다. \\\\n \\\\n블락비 본연의 색깔을 잘 살린 타이틀곡부터 첫 발라드 유닛곡 등 장르도 다양하다. 독특한 사운드와 개성 있는 랩을 들려주지만 트렌디함과 대중성을 놓치지 않았다. '몽타주(MONTAGE)'는 뮤지션으로 한층 견고해진 블락비의 진가를 확인할 수 있는 앨범이다. \\\\n \\\\n1. My Zone\\\\n첫 번째 트랙인 'My Zone'은 블락비의 원초적인 자유분방함을 다시금 느끼게 해주는 곡이다. 펑크, 일렉, 트랩 세 가지 장르가 하이브리드된 독특한 편곡은 곡을 듣는 내내 한시도 지루할 틈 없고, 후렴구의 기타 리프가 감각적이다. 'My Zone'이란 제목처럼 '어디가든 앵콜 요구 빗발쳐' 등의 스웩 넘치는 가사와 강렬한 래핑이 어우러져 에너지가 넘친다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, Penomeco / Composed by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J / Arranged by ZICO, Dirty Orange, Mitsu.J \\\\n\\\\n2. Shall We Dance \\\\n두 번째 트랙은 타이틀곡 'Shall We Dance'다. 지코가 프로듀싱한 곡으로 디지털과 아날로그 소스의 자연스러운 조화로 트렌디함과 빈티지한 감성을 동시에 느낄 수 있는 라틴 바이브의 업템포 댄스다. 독특한 사운드에 대중성까지 잘 녹여낸 이 곡은 평범함을 거부하는 블락비만의 매력이 가장 잘 담긴 트랙이다. 멤버들 각각의 개성이 잘 드러나는 랩과 '지금이 피크야 꽁무니 빼지마', '쭈뼛대는 사람은 못 껴' 등의 가사가 위트 있다. \\\\nLyrics by ZICO, 박경 / Composed by ZICO, Poptime / Arranged by ZICO, Poptime\\\\n\\\\n3. 일방적이야\\\\n세 번째 트랙 '일방적이야'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 노래이다. 대화로도 좁혀지지 않는 연인과의 입장 차이를 대변한 곡이다. '내 시간만 좀 가질라치면 그걸 바로 넌 마음의 크기라 정의해', '구속 아닌 구속으로 내 숨통을 조여 겨울인데도 더워' 등의 가사가 재미있고, 레게 리듬이 흥겨움을 더한다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경, ZICO / Composed by 박경, 13 / Arranged by 13\\\\n\\\\n4. 이렇게 (Vocal Unit)\\\\n네 번째 트랙 '이렇게'는 박경이 작사 작곡한 곡으로 블락비 보컬 유닛(메인보컬 태일, 재효, 유권, 비범)의 첫 발라드다. 놓쳐버린 사랑에 후회하는 연인들의 마음을 애절하게 풀어냈다. '어제의 꿈같았던 널'이란 가사가 특히 아련하게 다가온다. 감미로운 피아노 선율이 잔잔하게 깔리는 멜로디가 아름답고, 네 멤버의 목소리가 편안하고 포근하게 감싼다. \\\\nLyrics by 박경 / Composed by 박경, 심재훈, 박중훈 / Arranged by 박중훈\\\\n\\\\n5. Give & Take (B-BOMB Solo)\\\\n다섯 번째 트랙 'Give & Take'는 블락비의 퍼포먼스 라인 비범이 작사 작곡한 곡이다. 펑키한 일렉기타 리듬과 Synth Pad를 기반으로 한 디스코풍의 곡이다. 감각적인 비트에 비범의 섹시한 매력이 오롯이 담겼다.\\\\nLyrics by B-BOMB / Composed by B-BOMB, 김진호, 박현규 / Arranged by 김진호, 정동환, 최선용\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[CREDITS]\\\\n\\\\n1.

But a rogue genetic experiment gone awry mutates this gentle ape into a raging creature of enormous size.  To make matters worse, it’s soon discovered there are other similarly altered animals.  As these newly created alpha predators tear across North America, destroying everything in their path, Okoye teams with a discredited genetic engineer to secure an antidote, fighting his way through an ever-changing battlefield, not only to halt a global catastrophe but to save the fearsome creature that was once his friend.   \\\\n\\\\n “Rampage” also stars Oscar nominee Naomie Harris (“Moonlight”), Malin Akerman (TV’s “Billions”), Jake Lacy (TV’s “Girls”), Joe Manganiello (TV’s “True Blood”) and Jeffrey Dean Morgan (TV’s “The Walking Dead”); as well as P.J. Byrne (“The Wolf of Wall Street”), Marley Shelton (“Solace”), Breanne Hill (“San Andreas”), Jack Quaid (“The Hunger Games: Catching Fire”), and Matt Gerald (TV’s “Daredevil”). \\\\n\\\\nPeyton directs from a screenplay by Ryan Engle and Carlton Cuse & Ryan J. Condal and Adam Sztykiel, story by Ryan Engle, based on the video game Rampage. \\\\n\\\\n“Rampage is produced by Beau Flynn, John Rickard, Brad Peyton and Hiram Garcia.  It marks the third collaboration between Johnson, Peyton and Flynn, following the blockbuster hit “San Andreas.”  Serving as executive producers are Marcus Viscidi, Dwayne Johnson, Dany Garcia, Jeff Fierson, Toby Emmerich, Richard Brener and Michael Disco, with Wendy Jacobson co-producing. \\\\nThe creative team includes production designer Barry Chusid (“San Andreas”), director of photography Jaron Presant (2nd unit, “Star Wars: The Last Jedi”), editor Jim May (“Goosebumps”) and costume designer Melissa Bruning (“Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).  Music will be composed by Andrew Lockington, who created the scores for “San Andreas” and “Journey 2: The Mysterious Island.”\\\\nThe “Rampage” creatures are brought to life by acclaimed VFX supervisor Colin Strause (“San Andreas,” “X-Men: Apocalypse”), with five-time Academy Award-winning visual effects company Weta Digital (“The Lord of the Rings” Trilogy, “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes”).\\\\n\\\\n“Rampage” opens in theaters beginning April 20, 2018.\\\\nA New Line Cinema presentation, a Wrigley Pictures/Flynn Picture Company/7 Bucks Entertainment production, in association with ASAP Entertainment, “Rampage” will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, a Warner Bros. Entertainment Company.'],\n",
